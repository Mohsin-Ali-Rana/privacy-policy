<h1>Privacy Policy for FlashShare</h1>

This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>FlashShare</strong> ("we," "us," or "our")

user data is transferred directly between devices via a local connection
(Wi-Fi/Hotspot) and is <strong>not uploaded to our servers</strong>.
</p>

<h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

<h3>B. Contacts</h3>

and WebSockets.

    <li>No internet or third-party servers are involved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Data Security</h2>

    <li><strong>Local-Only Processing:</strong> Data stays within your local network.</li>
    <li><strong>Transient Storage:</strong> Temporary files may be cleared after transfer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The app may use third-party libraries for basic functionality and stability, including:
